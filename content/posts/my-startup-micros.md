      v
+------------+    +------------+    +------------+
| API Gateway|--->| Auth       |--->| Service    |
| (Kong)     |    | Middleware |    | Mesh       |
+------------+    +------------+    | (Linkerd)  |
                                    +------------+
                                         |
                                         v
+------------+    +------------+    +------------+
| Tenant     |<---| Domain     |<---| Database   |
| Context    |    | Service    |    | (Tenant-   |
| Middleware |    |            |    |  specific  |
+------------+    +------------+    |  schema)   |
                                    +------------+
```

1. Client sends request with tenant identifier (e.g., subdomain, header)
2. API Gateway validates request and extracts tenant information
3. Auth Middleware authenticates and authorizes the request
4. Service Mesh routes the request to the appropriate service
5. Tenant Context Middleware sets the tenant context for the request
6. Domain Service processes the request using tenant-specific data and business logic
7. Database access is scoped to the tenant's schema or collection
