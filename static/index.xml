      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-kafka&#34;&gt;Why Kafka?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Apache Kafka has always been one of my favourite technologies up to date. So I&amp;rsquo;m biased towards promoting it. That being said, the technology is a piece of art that can be used for everything under the sun from simple broker usage to large scale streaming solutions. Apache Kafka stands as a monumental innovation, offering unparalleled solutions to the challenges of data processing and streaming at scale. It was developed by Jay Kreps, Neha Narkhede, and Jun Rao at LinkedIn in 2010 and transcended its initial use case to become an elite platform for real-time data streaming, processing, and more.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Kubernetes 101: Intro to the Best Orchestrator in the World</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/kubernetes-101/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Kubernetes solves several critical problems in modern software development, particularly in managing containerized applications. As applications grow in complexity, managing these containers manually becomes untenable. Kubernetes offers a solution by providing automated orchestration, ensuring applications run efficiently and reliably across clusters of servers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-brief-history-lesson&#34;&gt;A Brief History Lesson&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Kubernetes, often abbreviated as K8s, has its roots in Google. Google&amp;rsquo;s extensive experience in running large-scale containerized applications led to the development of an internal project called Borg. Borg was designed to manage the thousands of containers running in Google&amp;rsquo;s vast data centers. Over time, Google recognized the potential benefits of open-sourcing a similar system to the broader community.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Writing Disposable Software: Hexagonal Architecture and DDD for Flexible Codebase</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/disposable-software/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The article delves into the concept of &amp;ldquo;disposable software&amp;rdquo; — not in the sense of throwaway code, but rather in creating systems that are so flexible and well-structured that any part can be easily replaced or updated without disrupting the whole. We&amp;rsquo;ll explore how combining Hexagonal Architecture with Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles, particularly in the Go programming language, can lead to more maintainable and adaptable codebases.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-disposable-mindset-a-first-principles-approach&#34;&gt;The Disposable Mindset: A First Principles Approach&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To truly understand the concept of disposable software, let&amp;rsquo;s start with first principles. What are the fundamental truths about software development that we can build upon?&lt;/p&gt;</description>
